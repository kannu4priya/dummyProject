        Mealtime was created in 2017 out of a passion for amazing food and service. The then one-man operation saw rapid growth after booking its very first eventâ€”catering the anniversary party for the Austin Film Society and its 1,000 guests. Through word of mouth, a lot of hard work and a commitment to producing
        one-of-a-kind events, Mealtime has become one of the most beloved catering companies in Austin.
        <br><br>
        We believe that using the freshest ingredients produces the best results. We are tireless in staying abreast of the latest food trends. And we are obsessed with creating customized menus and culinary masterpieces for our clients. Simply put: we exist to make your vision a reality.

        <h2 style="color: firebrick;">Brent Schumacher</h2>
        Brent Schumacher is the executive chef of Mealtime. She holds more than 11 years of restaurant and catering experience. Born and raised in Himachal Pradesh, her first professional position introduced her to the rewarding relationship between food and making people happy. It remains the foundation for what drives her today. Upon relocating to Haryana after 2010, she helped open the first Central Market, where she became executive sous chef. There she honed her culinary skills, learning from some of the country's most respected chefs. Her entrepreneurial spirit and desire to create unforgettable food led to the opening of Mealtime in 2017. Though she spends most of her time thinking about food, in her spare time, she loves competing in extreme ironman races, playing the drums, and staying on top of culinary trends. She's an animal lover, rottweiler devotee, and the proud leader of team Mealtime.

        <br>
        <span>1</span>
        <div class="question">
        Q: I'm interested in your catering services, what's the first step?
            <br><br>
        </div>
        A: You have several options: you can call us at (512)-656-4348, send us an email at info@pinkavocadocatering.com, or complete the event questionnaire on the "Contact" tab on our website. We'll gather details about your event and then we'll design a custom menu based on your unique preferences.

        <div class="question">
        Q: How do tastings work?
            <br><br>
        </div>
        A: We reserve several weekdays and Sundays for private tastings depending upon your schedule. Because our kitchen shops for and prepares your custom menu, there is a charge associated with the tasting based on your proposed menu cost. We think it's important you taste everything on the menu, so you can go into your event confident the food is amazing and what you envisioned. We require at least one-week advanced notice to schedule a tasting.
